Notes:
- Chart version follow semantic versioning(MAJOR, MINOR, PATCH).
- Chart appVersion is open to follow custom versioning based on application needs.
- Deployment liveness and readiness probes must be configured thinking application start time(initialDelaySeconds).
- Release selectors(tags) are in mutable so must be design previously.

Commands:
helm template release .
helm install release .
helm upgrade release .
