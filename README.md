# Ideation

This repository is focus on Ideation process about Software Engineering features, and it's implementation.  
So when we start with a solution design most activities are focused on problem/requirement analysis in order to  
understand it, defining one approach to address the problem/requirement and finally design the implementation.  
But depends on the problem/requirement complexity or level of knowledge on it the strategies to analyse it could  
change; the purpose of this content is share generic approaches to be used during Software/Solution design.

## Software Development Life Cycle

* Requirement Analysis
* Planning
* [Development](docs/development/development.md)
* Quality Assurance
* Release

## To Do

* Expand the details on Architecture and Development diagrams.
* Review the tooling(pre-commit, check-style, sonar-lint and others).
* Apply the tools selected to the project.

### Kubernetes

* Review usage of StatefulSet
* Try rolling updates with deployments
* Try batch processing with jobs and cron-jobs
* Implement an application to validate liveness and readiness probes
* Try management(considering pod allocation) resources with request and limits
